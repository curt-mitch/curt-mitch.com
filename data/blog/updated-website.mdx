summary: 'Migrating the website to Next.js and Vercel'

I've finally completed a major renovation of this website, after starting this work
almost 2 years ago. Better late than never! üòÖ

I hit a few roadblocks in trying to incrementally update my existing website's frontend codebase
from a standard [React](https://react.dev/)- and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-based app to a modern [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-based application, and more than once I
stepped away from this work for a few months. Probably the most difficult challenges included
trying to update several [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components between major versions of
that library, including some API changes that made the site's responsive design break in
sometimes subtle ways.

Ultimately I decided to rebuild the site using a [blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
I found the Next.js site. The template includes integrations with the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
framework and some easy configurations for email and site analytics. I also appreciate that the
template has built-in support for both dark and light themes, and the usage of the great
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) tool makes writing new posts much easier. On the previous version
of the site I was manually encoding the HTML and JSX around the text of each post!

And speaking of making updates easier, I've migrated the cloud hosting platform for this
site from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
(probably not too big of a surprise since Next.js is a Vercel-supported framework).
In order to make updates to the previous version of the site, I would have to SSH into my
DigitalOcean server, do a git pull on the website repository, and then rebuild new Docker
images before launching the containers (I also used Docker's image registry to skip the git
pull and image build steps). Using Vercel's [serverless](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless)
architecture and support in Github Actions makes writing a new post much easier; essentially
I just need to create a new markdown file (and upload any associated images), and then push
these to the deployment branch on Github. Greatly reducing the friction to updating the site
will it make that much easier to write new content. One cost of this migration is the Django
backend I hosted on DigitalOcean that allowed me to support APIs for my Japanese-English
translation and Urdu numeral-recognition systems, but I may try to find a way to restore
support for these in the future. As is, they were used very little and their large sizes meant I
was paying more than $20 per month in cloud usage fees.

Lastly, I also took some time with this refactor to do a little branding. The [golden
ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) (œÜ) is one of my favorite mathematical
constants, so I decided to make an SVG of the golden rectangle (a rectangle with side length
proportions are equal to the golden ratio) based on an [image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fibonacci_spiral.svg)
on Wikimedia that's in the public domain. Relatedly, I thought to give the website a name
rather than just ‚ÄúCurt-Mitch.com.‚Äù Playing off of the golden ratio idea, I thought ‚ÄúA
Marvelous Balance‚Äù seemed like a good name. It feels like an elegant title for a website
that contains writings on multiple interrelated topics.

In any case, I'm looking forward to writing interesting content about a variety of topics
on a more consistent cadence. If you'd like to, check out the repository for this site here:
